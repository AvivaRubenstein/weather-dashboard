# weather-dashboard

## Description

This project is a web application that allows the user to search for a city name to view the current weather and 5-day forecast for that location.  It saves their previously searched city names as buttons that can be clicked to run a repeat search on those locations.  Through building it, I practiced skills related to consuming APIs, such as sending fetch requests and extracting and utilizing relevant information from the data response.  I also practiced using local storage, appending the HTML file using javaScript, event listeners, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

## How to Contribute
