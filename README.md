# weather-dashboard

## Description

This project is a web application that allows the user to search for a city name to view the current weather and 5-day forecast for that location.  It saves their previously searched city names as buttons that can be clicked to run a repeat search on those locations.  Through building it, I practiced skills related to consuming APIs, such as sending fetch requests and extracting and utilizing relevant information from the data response.  I also practiced using local storage, appending the HTML file using javaScript, event listeners, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

## Installation

Visit https://avivarubenstein.github.io/weather-dashboard/ to open the application in the browser.  You can search the name of a city in the search bar and hit submit to see weather data for that location.  Previously searched items will be listed below the search button, and will be clickable to do a repeat search on the forecast for that location.
